    <h1>DTLab UTFORSK Partnership Program</h1>
    <p><strong>The aim of this project</strong> is to develop novel DTLab-based methods for BLS education outside the classroom and for aquaculture education across geographic locations.</p>

    <p><strong>DTLab UTFORSK partnership program</strong> was launched in order to strengthen international collaboration between Norwegian institutions and partners in China, Brazil and the USA.</p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Digital Twin Lab (DTLab) for International Biomedical Laboratory Science (BLS) Education</strong> project is a four-year project funded by the Norwegian Directorate for Higher Education and Skills.
      The project aims to enhance the quality of higher education in Norway, China and Brazil by developing and implementing a digital twin lab (DTLab) in lab courses, increasing student engagement in aquaculture and biomedical subjects, and strengthening the connection between theory and practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project is hosted by the <strong>Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)</strong> and partnered with <strong>Nankai University (Tianjin, China)</strong>, <strong>Federal University of Paraná (Paraná, Brazil)</strong>, and the <strong>University of New Hampshire (Durham, USA)</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Promote mobility of students and university staff to expand networks and enhance study quality.</li>
      <li>Establish a common DTLab-based learning platform as a sustainable model for BLS education.</li>
      <li>Increase students' motivation and competence through designing, developing, using, and evaluating DTLab systems across multiple learning programs, including clinical lab practice.</li>
      <li>Integrate education, research, and innovation by developing DTLab-based learning approaches.</li>
      <li>Strengthen links with future careers by connecting biomedical laboratory science (BLS) education with international clinical practice.</li>
      <li>Follow-up and disseminate research results through publications, conferences, and seminars on DTLab’s educational impact.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Partners</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>NTNU - Department of Biological Sciences Ålesund (IBA)</li>
      <li>NTNU - Department of Biomedical Laboratory Science (IBF)</li>
      <li>Nankai University, China</li>
      <li>Federal University of São Paulo, Brazil</li>
      <li>University of New Hampshire, USA</li>
      <li><strong>Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)</strong> - Lead partner organization</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The Department of Biological Sciences (IBA) and the Department of Biomedical Laboratory Science (IBF) focus on pedagogical teaching methods, student-active learning, and e-learning. Efforts are being made to simulate and digitize laboratories. IBA has used a virtual lab for BLS students and recently developed "Flipped Lab Room in the subject BL221412" and "Norwegian-Brazilian Partnership Program on Sustainable Aquaculture Systems."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Department of Ocean Operations and Civil Engineering (IHB) at NTNU, as a leading actor in Norway, focuses on digitalization, ship intelligence, and human interaction in demanding operations such as the SFI MOVE project, Digital Ocean Space Center project, and KPN Digital Twinship.
